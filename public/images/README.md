# Profile Photo Instructions

## Adding Your Profile Photo

1. Save your professional headshot photo as `profile.jpg` in the `public/images/` directory
2. The photo should ideally be:
   - Square aspect ratio (1:1)
   - High resolution (at least 400x400 pixels)
   - Professional quality with good lighting
   - JPG or PNG format

## Current Setup
The Hero component has been updated to display your profile photo from `/images/profile.jpg`

## Alternative Options
If you want to use a different filename or format:
1. Update the `src` attribute in `src/components/Hero.tsx`
2. Change the path from `/images/profile.jpg` to your preferred filename

The image will be automatically optimized by Next.js for better performance.
